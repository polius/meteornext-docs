# Coins

The Coins view shows:

- The amount of coins you have.
- How many coins does it cost to make a deployment.

Coins are consumed performing Deployments. And the amount of coins that are consumed depends on the user's group settings.

This setting is defined in the [Group](administration/groups#deployments) section, the field named `Coins per execution`.
