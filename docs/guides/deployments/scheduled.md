# Scheduled

Scheduled deployments are used to program a deployment to be executed automatically in a given time.

This feature comes in four flavors:

- **[One-Time execution](#one-time-execution)**: Execute a deployment once in a given datetime.
- **[Daily execution](#daily-execution)**: Execute a deployment each day at the same time.
- **[Weekly execution](#weekly-execution)**: Execute a deployment in a specific time on the desired week days.
- **[Monthly execution](#monthly-execution)**: Execute a deployment in a specific time on the desired months.
