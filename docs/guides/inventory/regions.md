# Regions

A region is a resource identified by a **name** and **ssh tunnel** settings. This resource is needed in order to create servers. A server always is attached to a region. In this way we can share a ssh tunnel config across multiple servers without needing to fill all the ssh tunnel configuration for every new server.

This section contains all the regions we have created in our account.

To create a new Region, there's some fields that must be filled: **Name** and **SSH Tunnel** (disabled by default).
