# Setup

After starting the meteor2 container it's now time to configure the application.

Open a web browser such as Firefox or Google Chrome and go to the following page:

```bash
http://host-ip:1234
```

> Change `host-ip` for the host ip where the meteor2 container is running.

After entering the URL the Login page will be shown. At this point click the `INSTALL` button.
